* Detect event over iframe
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5645485/detect-mousemove-when-over-an-iframe#15318321

UI feel super sticky and doesn't seem to work.

when some kind of event is happening I probably want some kind of
global state which will cause all iframes to create an invisible div
over them so that events can continue to propagate
* color scheme
* theme?

what should the idea behind the look be?

what should I focus on conveying?
** Layout of design
where should i place name

where should other objects go?

what pages should there be?
