[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kesha-sexual-assault-why-women-dont-come-forward_us_56c77579e4b0928f5a6bcd51)
has written an article that attempts to illuminate the failings of the criminal
justice system in handling rape and sexual assault cases. The article cites many
different sources to back up its claims. Do these references validate these
claims of a failed legal system? I hope you follow along and review these
citations as well.

In my mind this paragraph highlights the main arguments being made in the
article; the first claim is that the justice system often doesn't protect
victims of sexual abuse and references this article,
["Victims of Rape and Sexual Assault, Failed by Criminal Justice System, Increasingly Seek Civil Remedies"](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2016/01/08/victims-rape-sexual-assault-failed-criminal-justice-system-increasingly-seek-civil-remedies/).
The second claim is that rape remains one of the most grossly underreported
crimes citing,
"[Reporting Rates](https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates)",
from the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network :

> **Why Will Only 2 Out of Every 100 Rapists Serve Time?**
> ![Rapist infographic](https://www.rainn.org/files/uploadedFiles/Jailed-rapists%20December%202014.jpg)

As you can see, each of these data bars has a reference. The topmost data bar
that says, "out of every 100 rapes, 32 get reported to police", references the
Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization surveys from
2008-2012.

First, I will be looking at the Bureau of Justice Statistics'
[2014 National Crime Victimization survey](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv14.pdf)
to see if the claim that "rape is grossly underreported" is a reasonable claim.
Page 2 of the survey introduces victimizations, saying, "Victimization is the
basic unit of analysis used throughout most of this report. A victimization is a
crime as it affects one person or household. For personal crimes, the number of
victimizations is equal to the number of victims present during a criminal
incident. The number of victimizations may be greater than the number of
incidents because more than one person may be victimized during an incident.
Each crime against a household is counted as having a single victim—the affected
household." Looking at page 7, table 6 of the survey, it is shown that for 2014
the percent of victimizations reported to police for rape/sexual assault was
33.6% and previous years appear to be around this percentage. This level of
reporting is lower than any other form of violent crime. Theft is the only other
form of crime in this survey that has a lower report percentage of 29.0%
for 2014. The classification of violent crimes, has an average of 46.0% of
victimizations reported to police for 2014 and the classification of property
crime has a report percentage of 37.0%. So, is rape grossly underreported?
Rape/sexual assault is underreported, when looking at the report:victimization
ratio of rape/sexual assault and comparing that to the report:victimization
ratio of other violent crimes. But, rape/sexual assault has the lowest number of
estimated victimizations of any crime in the survey for 2014, with 284,350
victimizations (page 2, table 1 and page 3, table 3 for property
victimizations). Here I'll look at the absolute number of unreported
victimizations of violent crimes by using the data from table 1, "Violent
victimizations", on page 2, and table 6, "Percent of victimizations reported to
police, by type of crime", on page 7 :

{% highlight js %}
let r be decimal percentage of reported victimizations
let v be victimizations
let u be unreported victimizations

Unreported victimizations equation
(1.0 - r) * v = u

Rape/sexual assault
(1.0 - 0.336) * 284,350   =   188,808.4 

Robbery
(1.0 - 0.609) * 664,210   =   259,706.1

Aggravated assault
(1.0 - 0.584) * 1,092,090 =   454,309.44

Simple assault
(1.0 - 0.400) * 3,318,920 =   1,991,352.1

{% endhighlight %}

These calculations show that although rape/sexual assault has the lowest report
rate of 33.6%, since it has the lowest number of victimizations of any of the
violent crimes, it has the lowest number of unreported victimizations.

"The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) collects information on nonfatal
crimes, reported and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 or older
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. During 2014, about
90,380 households and 158,090 persons were interviewed for the NCVS," the Bureau
of Justice Statistics
[describes](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5366). Can I believe
the estimates that the NCVS provides for these violent crimes? Could there be
more victims of rape that are even unwilling to speak of the crime to NCVS
interviewers? The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network believes this data,
and cites this series of surveys in their info graphic that was cited in the
original Huffington Post article. 

Why is the number of rape/sexual assault
victimizations low in comparison to other violent crimes if
"[Rape Culture is Real](http://time.com/40110/rape-culture-is-real/)"?

>And, "[Nearly 1 in 5 women (18.3%) and 1 in 71 men (1.4%) in the United States have been raped at some time in their lives, including completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, or alcohol/drug facilitated completed penetration](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf)"?

I am not sure. The survey gives some insight, saying, "BJS estimates of rape and
sexual assault from the NCVS have typically been lower than estimates derived
from other federal and private surveys. However, the NCVS methodology and
definitions of rape and sexual assault differ from many of these surveys in
important ways that contribute to the variation in estimates of the prevalence
and incidence of these victimizations."(page 13) How much larger of an estimate
could be made with definitions even more inclusive than the rape and sexual
assault definitions from page 13? 

>"**Rape** is the unlawful penetration of a person against the will of the
>victim, with use or threatened use of force, or attempting such an act. Rape
>includes psychological coercion and physical force, and forced sexual
>intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the offender. Rape also
>includes incidents where penetration is from a foreign object (e.g., a bottle),
>victimizations against male and female victims, and both heterosexual and
>homosexual rape. Attempted rape includes verbal threats of rape. **Sexual
>assault** is defined across a wide range of victimizations, separate from rape
>or attempted rape. These crimes include attacks or attempted attacks generally
>involving unwanted sexual contact between a victim and offender. Sexual assault
>may or may not involve force and includes grabbing or fondling."

I could also attempt to provide reasons for the relatively low number of
victimizations. Perhaps violent robbery often affects more than 1 person, unlike
rape/sexual assault does? Thus the number of victimizations of robbery are
multiplied, being much higher than the number of incidents. What about assault?
The same treatment? Victimizations are some multiple of the incidents? While
thinking about this it seems victimizations are a very general measure of
criminal activity, since in counting number of victimizations many things could
have occurred during the incident of the crime. Victimizations count in multiple
types of crimes for 1 victim, such as a victim of robbery could have been
assaulted and raped, then would be counted in all 3 for that 1 incident. It also
counts multiple instances with 1 person, so, in cases like domestic violence,
someone could be a victimized several times and each time counts as a
victimization. This could inflate the victimizations relative to the number of
victims if a perpetrator is not stopped and is allowed to repeat the act. In
fact there is ~1.8 victimizations per victim of violent crime (2014 NCVS page 2,
table 1 and page 5, table 4). There is also the gender issue of rape/sexual
assault, since stated above, women are more likely to be raped, and one would
think that both men and women would be robbed and assaulted equally often.
This could make the crime seem less prevalent since it mainly affects women But,
on page 6, table 5 it shows that for 2014 the number of people victimized
by violent crime for men and women is almost equal. 1,497,430 men and 1,451,110
women are estimated to be victims. This means that men must be more likely to be
victims of some other form of violent crime. It is difficult from such a form of
measurement to try to interpret the events of incidents of crime. Taking the
data as a rough indication of the amount of different forms of crime seems to be
the intention of the survey, since it does not provide much analysis as to the
reason why crimes have their number of victims. The authors mainly highlight
annual trends in the numbers.

Why is the percentage of rape/sexual assault victimizations reported to police
so much lower in comparison to other violent crimes? I concur that it is
possible that there could be a cultural stigma against reporting incidents, for
whatever reason. But, that is speculatory and different from saying that rape is
an actual cultural norm. Many more people claim to be affected by assault, as
well as robbery. The data from the NCVS doesn't seem to support the claims that
rape culture is real in the U.S and that rape is a grossly underreported crime.
Rape/sexual assault is apparent, but is a minority of violent crime, and
because of this, many more instances of other violent crimes go unreported.

Now looking at the claim that victims of sexual abuse
"[face a justice system that often doesn't protect them](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2016/01/08/victims-rape-sexual-assault-failed-criminal-justice-system-increasingly-seek-civil-remedies/)".

My summary of this reference is that victims of rape are increasingly filing
civil suits against their alleged rapists, rather than filing criminal suits.
The article distinguishes the two different forms of legal trials by saying that
:

>Unlike criminal trials, which require the prosecution to prove the defendant’s
>guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt,” civil trials have a much lower bar,
>requiring only that a plaintiff persuade a judge or jury that it is more likely
>than not that the events occurred.

A longer description of the difference between the two can be found
[here](http://www.cscja-acjcs.ca/criminal_civil_law-en.asp?l=4). 

Criminal law is the standard by which homicide and assault cases are
tried, but this system is failing rape and sexual assault victims, the author
claims, because:

> [victims] frequently face juries
> [biased by cultural assumptions about rape](http://www.aequitasresource.org/EducatingJuriesInSexualAssaultCasesPart1.pdf).

and :

> according to a
> [recent White House report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/sexual_assault_report_1-21-14.pdf#page=9),
> ...“law enforcement officers and prosecutors are not fully trained on the
> nature of these crimes or how best to investigate and prosecute them.”

and :

>“We [in society] generally don’t second-guess people who say that they were
>burglarized or say that their car was stolen or who say that they were
>assaulted, but we absolutely second-guess people that claim that they were
>sexually assaulted,” former special victims prosecutor Roger Canaff told RH
>Reality Check in a phone interview. “We either are skeptical of the truth of
>the allegation or we look to blame that person.”

I shall now look at the Bureau of Justice Statistics'
[Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2006](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fssc06st.pdf),
to try to see how sexual assault conviction rates compare to other forms of
crime. If sexual assault cases face so many difficulties in courts, as the
"Victims of Sexual Assault, Failed by Justice System, ... " article claims, then
it should be reflected in the felony conviction data.
