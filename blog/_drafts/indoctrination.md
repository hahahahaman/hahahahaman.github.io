<blockquote>
<p> Man is not willingly a political animal. The human male associates with his
fellows less by desire than by habit, imitation and the compulsion of
circumstance; he does not love society so much as he fears solitude. He combines
with other men because isolation endangers him, and because there are many
things that can be done better together than alone; in his heart he is a
solitary individual, pitted heroically against the world. If the average man had
had his way there would probably never have been any state. Even today he
resents it, classes death with taxes, and yearns for that government which
governs least. If he asks for many laws it is only because he is sure that his
neighbor needs them; privately he is an unphilosophical anarchist, and thinks
laws in his own case superfluous. </p>

Perhaps one can only imagine, when first reading such a paragraph, that the
author projects his own nature onto the world, given the boldness of the claim.
But, having read it again and from reading the work, the presented context of
primitive men seems to lead to the notion that the author's description of
humanity is plausible. What is intriguing, then, is why the idea that man is
born into the world with an immediate and constant sense of loneliness, seems so
cynical and foreign, if it at any point approaches reality.

Clearly a society that perpetuates the idea that people should engage in
activities together, by rewarding those that enable and enforce this behavior,
perpetuates itself. But, what activities? The book gives a much better treatment
of the origins of custom, instinct, and law than I can. And why reward them?
Because it is unnatural and because our rulers have something to gain. I suppose
that is what people refer to as a _conspiracy theory_. Listen to Chris Hedges or
Bernie Sanders or read the Great Gatsby if you wish to hear the prodding of the
oligarchic ruling class. (The movie adaptation is not good, but I wonder if the
director was trying to arouse the interest of a rich married woman, because the
whole performance seemed contrived and unnecessarily extravagant.)
