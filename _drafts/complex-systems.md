title: Complex Systems

It's been 2 years since I first glanced at a lisp language. I've never actually gotten through SICP, I find it pretty boring doing the exercises,
 but looking over the first couple sections on function and data abstraction, I finally realized how much they were trying to hammer into the reader the idea of building complexity through simpler atomic parts.
First with recursion, a function acts as it's own building block, creating an indefinitely large self.
Then with the closure property, or nesting property, where a data structure can contain within it the same kind of data structure, like an array of arrays. 
They introduce cons, which is an object that can point to two lisp object. It is a super minimal and incredibly general glue of sorts.
