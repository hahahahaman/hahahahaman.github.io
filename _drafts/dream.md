-bus trip from town to town, go through some magical forest
-eventually hit some sign that warns of giant bear thing
-go out and look at sign then giant bear attacks, everyone goes back in and
then drive away
- reach some town in the middle of the forest, unclear what it does, odd
buildings and object litter the sides of the road
-fall in state of half sleep
- eventually night fall
- bear comes again bus crashes into it and totals the bus
- a train of buses come onto the road, apparently bikes are on board, so take
everything on bikes and follow buses
- go into town following, buses, see huge group of people,
- walk around, someone tells the group that they must separate into the
  segregated racial groups, argument erupts
