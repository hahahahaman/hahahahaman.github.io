title: Describing to the inanimate.
---

If you've ever watched a [talk by Gerald J. Sussman][role of programming]
([also here][dont know how to compute]) on the usage of programming language to
convey knowledge, you've probably thought that he raised some unexpected points
about the impressionistic behavior of _"natural"_ communication. To me it is
surprising that the problems of ambiguity are so easily brushed off or even
ignored completely. I would not expect a solution to such an open ended problem,
but surely it seems important enough to be thought of almost in every situation
involving language. Paraphrasing what he says: natural language is inconsistent
in its symbolism, thus communication of ideas are based on the assumption that
the speaker and the listener are largely similar, to the point where something
"new" is a small incremental step in knowledge that (relatively) easily
integrates into their understanding, prior to the conversation; one thus must
engage in a long process of immersion to gain a strong enough understanding to
follow the progression of vague, ambiguous symbolism that is presented; math and
English being examples of such a set of symbols. The worst situation I can
really imagine is that a person ignorant to the fact they are describing a
specific idea, using language rife with ambiguity, creates misinformation,
leading to confusion in its conception even within themselves.

Carl Jung alludes to the fact that because of unique traits in all of us the
meaning of words can vary.
