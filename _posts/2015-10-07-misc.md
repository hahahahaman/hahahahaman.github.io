Setup this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog... I'm not sure what I'm doing. Reading about what [this guy](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) did. Seems like a course of action. Yup.

Ok, after a while things seem to be resonable; got a color scheme, got a name, found out firefox inspector is pretty useful, as well as some auto-reload plugin that refeshs my pages when a change occurs. I'm wondering if I should get comments and google analytics, but it's not like I need someone's server to tell me how truly lonely I am. I know. Everyone knows. But, perhaps not conciously, only in primordial thoughts, that lurk deep in the recesses of the unconcious, can they fathom the vast seperation among men.
